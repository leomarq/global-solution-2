Front end project for conclusion of the second semester in my college course, in partership with Microsoft and Kraft Heinz, themed "AI feeding the future", i.e., how artificial intelligente can have a part in the fight against world hunger.

Our group's idea for this project was a website which helps the user to build and maintain their own food garden.

This project was built with React.
